# Diabetes
Hi, this is my first project on Machine Learning. For this beginner level project, I took the dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/diabetescsv)". After uploading the dataset on my python notebook, I cleaned it by removing null values, checking for duplicate values, etc. I also checked for correlation between features and picked the best four to train the model. The model was trained using Logistic regression and below is the result 
True Negatives (TN): 61
False Positives (FP): 39
False Negatives (FN): 11
True Positives (TP): 43
